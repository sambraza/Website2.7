      <description>Introduction Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Sam Braza. I created this site to post some of my ideas in philosophy, as well as to show some of the things I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on. I graduated in 2020 from Santa Clara University with degrees in philosophy and biochemistry. I am actively pursuing biomedical research, but I still have interests in philosophy, especially in metaphysics, epistemology, and bioethics.
