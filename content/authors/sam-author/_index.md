## 

Hi, my name is Sam. I'm an incoming medical student. I created this site to post some of my philosophical thoughts, as well as show some of the things I'm currently working on. I graduated in 2020 from Santa Clara University with degrees in philosophy and biochemistry. I am actively pursuing biomedical research, but I still have interests in philosophy, especially in metaphysics, epistemology, and bioethics.
