# Education

*Santa Clara University*, B.S. Biochemistry, B.A. Philosophy. Santa Clara, CA. \hfill 2020

# Research

*Enveda Biosciences*,  Research Technician. \hfill 2021

* Drug discovery work aimed at discovering and testing pharmaceutically active compounds in plants.
* Helped develop and test proteomics and metabolomics protocols, using literature reviews to identify useful protocols that could be modified for current research needs.
* Performed various experiments on various cells and plant extracts.

*Santa Clara University, Abbyad Lab*. Research Assistant. \hfill 2017-2020

* Research aimed at developing label-free sorting sorting systems, in order to quickly isolate metabolically-active cancer cells for genomic analysis, as well as sort enzymes based on activity.
* Designed experiments and contributed to finding that with surfactant QX-100 present, droplet surface tension is inversely associated with pH. Performed control experiments to confirm findings.
* Designed and tested many novel microfluidic chips to address sorting issues.
* Led efforts to improve sorting system throughput, coordinating between lab members.
* Wrote portions of two published manuscripts, contributed to grant writing, wrote Honors Thesis, and performed literature reviews to find citations and keep the group up to date on current research.

*UCCS Department of Physics, Glushchenko Lab*. Research Assistant. \hfill 2016

* Work aimed at improving zinc oxide microrod length through varying reagents.
* Conducted experiments with different reagents and used scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy to measure rods.
* Performed analyses with a variety of spectroscopic techniques.
* Reviewed literature and contributed to manuscript writing.
